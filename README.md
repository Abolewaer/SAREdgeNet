SAREdgeNet: SAR Lake Edge Detection System

Project Overview

SAREdgeNet is a comprehensive Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) lake edge detection system that integrates deep learning and traditional image processing technologies. The system is specifically designed to automatically identify, extract, and analyze edge information of water bodies such as lakes from complex SAR remote sensing images, providing precise data support for applications including water resource monitoring, environmental change analysis, and disaster early warning. The system adopts a modular architecture design, decomposing the entire processing pipeline into five interconnected yet relatively independent processing stages, each of which has been deeply optimized for specific technical challenges, ensuring that the entire processing chain from raw SAR data to final edge detection results is both efficient and accurate.

SAR imagery, as an active remote sensing technology, possesses all-weather and all-time observation capabilities, making it particularly suitable for water body monitoring. However, distinguishing water bodies from surrounding features in SAR images often presents significant challenges, especially under complex terrain and varying imaging conditions, where traditional edge detection methods often fail to achieve satisfactory results. The SAREdgeNet system constructs an end-to-end processing framework by combining the powerful feature extraction capabilities of deep learning with the precision of traditional image processing techniques, enabling automatic completion of all work from data preprocessing to final result output, while fully preserving geographic reference information throughout the entire processing process, allowing detection results to be directly used for subsequent analysis in Geographic Information Systems (GIS).

System Architecture and Technical Implementation

The core architecture of the system is built upon five main processing modules, each of which undertakes specific functional responsibilities and achieves seamless integration through standardized data interfaces. The first module is the data preprocessing module (Part1_PreProcess), which is responsible for handling various format conversions, coordinate system unification, and image quality enhancement of raw SAR images. In practical applications, SAR data often comes from different sensors, different imaging times, and different geographic coordinate systems. The preprocessing module, by integrating professional geospatial information processing libraries such as rasterio and GDAL, can automatically identify and convert various coordinate systems, ensuring consistency in subsequent processing. Additionally, this module implements a tiled processing mechanism for large-scale SAR images, enabling the system to handle SAR image files of several GB or even larger through intelligent memory management and tiling strategies, which is crucial for large-scale data processing in practical applications.

The second module is the DoG edge detection module (Part2_DogDectection), which implements edge detection functionality based on the Difference of Gaussians (DoG) algorithm. The DoG algorithm is a classic multi-scale edge detection method that effectively extracts edge features from images by computing the difference of images filtered at different Gaussian scales. In SAR image processing, the DoG algorithm is particularly suitable for preliminary edge candidate region extraction because it has certain robustness to noise while being able to detect edge features at different scales. This module not only implements the standard DoG algorithm but also optimizes it for SAR image characteristics, including adaptive threshold selection, edge quality assessment, and candidate region filtering functions, ensuring that the extracted edge information is both comprehensive and accurate.

The third module is the deep learning training and prediction module (Part3_Train_Predict), which is the core innovation of the entire system. This module, based on the PyTorch deep learning framework, implements a ResNet-34 classification network specifically optimized for SAR grayscale images. Unlike traditional ResNet-34, this network is specifically designed for the single-channel characteristics of SAR images, modifying the original three-channel input layer to a single-channel input, while using transfer learning to initialize with ImageNet pre-trained weights and then fine-tuning for SAR image characteristics. The network architecture adopts a dual-path feature extraction design, with one path focusing on extracting visual features from the image itself, while the other path processes geometric features of contours. Features from both paths are fused at the end to jointly participate in classification decisions. This design enables the network to simultaneously utilize both intensity information and geometric structure information from SAR images, significantly improving classification accuracy.

During training, the system supports complete training functionalities including batch data loading, data augmentation, learning rate scheduling, and model checkpoint saving. Training data can come from user-annotated samples, and the system automatically performs data splitting, standardization, and feature extraction. The training process displays training metrics such as loss curves and accuracy curves in real-time, helping users monitor training progress and model performance. In the prediction phase, the system can perform automated edge classification prediction on entire SAR images, with prediction results visualized in color-coded output while fully preserving the geographic reference information of the original image, allowing prediction results to be directly overlaid on geographic base maps for display and analysis.

The fourth module is the post-processing optimization module (Part4_Polish), which is responsible for further optimization and refinement of the deep learning model's prediction results. Although deep learning models can provide high classification accuracy, in practical applications, prediction results often still contain some small noise regions, incomplete contours, and small connected components. The post-processing module can automatically clean these noises through functions such as contour filling, connected component analysis, and area threshold filtering, making the final detection results cleaner and more accurate. The contour filling function can automatically identify detected lake contours and fill the regions inside the contours with the target category, which is crucial for complete extraction of lake regions. The connected component cleaning function analyzes connected regions in the image, automatically removing noise regions with areas smaller than the threshold while retaining major lake regions. Additionally, this module implements a red difference analysis function that can compare and analyze differences between prediction results and reference data, helping users evaluate detection effectiveness.

The fifth module is the edge-guided pixel conversion module (Part5_Final), which is the final step of the entire processing pipeline and a key component for achieving precise edge localization. This module implements an edge-guided pixel conversion algorithm based on edge information detected in previous steps. The core idea of the algorithm is to perform precise classification conversion of pixels within a certain range near edges based on edge direction and intensity information. This edge-guided method can effectively improve edge detection accuracy and reduce edge position deviations. The module supports configurable edge expansion pixel numbers, allowing users to adjust the edge expansion range according to actual needs, finding a balance between detection accuracy and processing efficiency. Additionally, this module supports batch processing functionality, enabling automated edge-guided processing of all images in a folder, greatly improving processing efficiency.


Application Scenarios and Value

The SAREdgeNet system has important application value and broad application prospects in multiple fields. In the field of water resource management, the system can be used to monitor area changes of water bodies such as lakes and reservoirs. By regularly monitoring using SAR images, time series data of water body areas can be established, analyzing patterns of seasonal and interannual changes in water bodies, providing scientific basis for water resource assessment, planning, and decision-making. In the field of disaster monitoring and early warning, the system plays a key role in flood monitoring and drought monitoring. When floods occur, SAR images can penetrate clouds and rain fog to timely acquire images of affected areas, and the system can quickly identify flood inundation areas, providing support for disaster assessment and rescue decision-making. In drought monitoring, the system can monitor the shrinkage of water bodies such as lakes and reservoirs, providing data support for drought early warning and response. In the field of environmental change research, the system can be used to monitor environmental change processes such as glacier melting and wetland changes. Through long-term monitoring, trends in these environmental elements can be analyzed, providing data support for climate change research and ecological environment protection. Particularly in areas where field surveys are difficult, such as high-altitude and high-latitude regions, SAR remote sensing technology combined with automated edge detection systems provides important technical means for environmental monitoring. In the field of ecological research, the system can be used to monitor changes in lake ecosystems, including expansion or contraction of lake areas and changes in lake shapes. This information has important value for understanding the succession processes of lake ecosystems and assessing the impacts of human activities on lake ecosystems, providing scientific support for ecological protection and sustainable development.
